Introduction

This repository contains data and analysis on the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rates, obesity rates, and respiratory death rates in the United States. The data was cleaned and prepared using Excel, and the analysis was performed using Jupyter notebooks.

Data Cleaning

The data used in this analysis was sourced from publicly available datasets. To ensure accuracy and consistency, the data was cleaned and prepared using Microsoft Excel. This involved removing irrelevant data, filling in missing values, and converting data types where necessary.

Visualization and Analysis

The cleaned data was then imported into Jupyter notebooks where it was visualized and analyzed using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Linregress. The analysis focused on exploring the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rates, obesity rates, and respiratory death rates.
